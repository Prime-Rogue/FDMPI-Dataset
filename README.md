**Description:**

The original FDMPI dataset is comprised of 325 images containing 415 defect samples, all sourced from the flaw detection process of an actual forging production line. To bolster the robustness of our models and better simulate real-world conditions, we employed a data augmentation method for deep saliency prediction as proposed by Bahar Aydemir et al. [16]. Following this augmentation, the dataset was expanded to 4,622 images, encompassing 15,492 defect samples. The augmented dataset was then partitioned into a training set of 3,206 images (11,700 samples) and a validation/test set of 1,416 images (3,792 samples). All samples within the dataset are labeled as defective. Additionally, the dataset features 1,200 segmented forging images with corresponding annotations, which are used for training upstream models in forging segmentation tasks. Examples from the FDMPI dataset are illustrated in Fig.1.

**How to use the database:**

This dataset supports YOLO format and can be used for object detection and semantic segmentation.
